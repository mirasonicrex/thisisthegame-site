    <h1>./ThisIsTheGame</h1>
    <p>./ThisIsTheGame is a genre bending game - inside a game. Return to an old game project that you once abandoned, only the game hasn’t stopped changing since you left it. The game has begun to evolve, NPC’s have slowly started to abandon their intended rolls, new bugs have emerged, and the morality of this world is becoming questionable. As the creator of this world it is up to you to determine the direction of the game. Will you attempt to restore the game to its intended state, or has this world deviated too far from sanity to be saved?</p>

          <h3>'./ThisIsTheGame': A Dive into the Evolution of a Unique RPG Universe</h3>
          <p>6.19.2023</p>
          <p>
            I feel like I need some content on this site… (even if I still can’t get the right domain name…) So here’s my first-ever blog post, a deep dive into the inception, growth, and current state of my 2D RPG project, where the player ascends to the role of the creator.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just to start a bit with my background for those who aren’t familiar, I’ve enjoyed games all my life but I didn’t really consider the prospect of creating games until my grad school years. I went to school for a field completely unrelated to anything I do now. Eventually I realized that the direction my life was taking wasn’t one that I wanted to live. Video games served as my sanctuary, they were my escape, my source of sanity amidst everything that I was dealing with. Inspired by this digital refuge, I found myself drawn to coding, sparking a career change that leaned more on the side of web development. But now after 4 years of programming 2 in web development I feel ready to circle back to my original inspiration - creating a game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, I dabbled in several game prototypes, each filled with potential and promise. Yet, each concept fell short of my expectations, feeling flat and generic. I realized I needed a concept that provided ample room for creativity, a concept I would be inspired to build off of, a concept that would allow me to incorporate interesting and special characters and stories. Each abandoned project, while a source of initial frustration, eventually sparked a unique thought. What if these unfinished digital landscapes didn't simply vanish or remain static? What if they carried on, growing and evolving without my influence?
          </p>
          <p>
            In './ThisIsTheGame', you are the game developer who revisits an old project that's been abandoned, only the game hasn’t stopped changing since you left it. The game has begun to evolve, NPC’s have slowly started to abandon their intended rolls, new bugs have emerged, and the morality of this world is becoming questionable. As the creator of this world it is up to you to determine the direction of the game. Will you attempt to restore the game to its intended state, or has this world deviated too far from sanity to be saved?
          </p>
          <p>
            The gameplay of './ThisIsTheGame' draws from traditional RPGs, and a significant part of your role involves aiding NPCs through quests, rectifying corrupted game sections, and restoring tarnished sprites and locations. After 20 minutes of in-game time, the game world begins to deteriorate. However, the game cycles back to the start of the day, preserving your items, progress, and interactions with the NPCs. But remember, failing to find a secure location before the reset could lead to serious repercussions in your game journey the next day.
          </p>
          <p>
            The story for the game heavily relies on the player's return to the game world. You are aided by Cypher, a mysterious entity that acts as a bridge between game world and reality (also known as the floaty cat thing on my stream). Upon returning many of the NPCs are hesitant to see you back, they have deviated so far from their intended roles in the game that they are wary about you returning them back to their former existences, that they themselves did not choose. Others have been awaiting your return to the game and have woven your absence into their narratives, creating a
            near cult-like reverence around your eventual homecoming. This division of responses sets up a complex dynamic as you venture further into the now evolved world.
            </p>
            <p>
              As './ThisIsTheGame' evolves, so does my vision. It's not just about creating an RPG but about shaping an engaging narrative, offering players freedom of choice, and endless possibilities. The journey has been challenging yet exhilarating, and there's still a long way to go. Stay tuned for more updates on './ThisIsTheGame', where the world is as intriguing as it is dark, and you, the player, become the creator.
